# What is this?
A proof of concept. Please note all code is clientside, you cannot jump around with your friends right now.
Actually a little bit of an accidental benchmark, too; you can see the difference in performance between a large field of blocks vs a smaller one. (Jump off the bottom of the screen to respawn a new field of cubes with random dimension.)
